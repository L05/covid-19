# My experience with an undiagnosed illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.
*NOTE: I want to be clear that I am not a healthcare professional. If you feel you are having a medical emergency, please contact your doctor or 911 ASAP!*

A few friends have suggested I share this in case it's helpful to anyone feeling similarly. I am not sure exactly what I have been ill with since my condition wasn't considered bad or critical enough to be tested for COVID-19, and I wasn't considered at risk (despite history of bad asthma as a child). I can say it has been unlike anything I've been sick with before, specifically with how it has affected my breathing. Let me know if you have any questions about any of this!

## My symptoms, in order of onset<a name="symptoms"></a>

* Post nasal drip
* Sore throat 
* Diarrhea 
* Shallow breath / tight chest / reduction in breathing capacity -- I have had asthma attacks and the difficulty breathing from this was not like an attack, but more a longer reduction in what I would describe as breathing capacity. Since it started, I feel like in general my breathing capacity was reduced to 85-90%, and it would dip to 50% for periods. My breathing would get shallower, and it would feel tighter in my chest. I would sometimes get dizzy and need to lay down for periods of time. Even now as Iâ€™m feeling better, my breathing feels like itâ€™s remained at 85-90%.
* Fatigue/Very tired and out of it 
* Chills 
* Dry cough 
* Headache

## Medicine/Supplies<a name="supplies"></a>

* Vitamin C/Vitamin D3 (daily for immune boost) 
* Zicam/Zinc dissolving lozenges (taken at any signs of sore throat or irritation) 
* Umcka Cold and Flu or Umcka Cold Care (3x day while having any cough/respiratory issues) 
* Mucinex (loosens mucus) 
* Robitussin DM or Mucinex DM (loosens mucus, suppresses coughing) 
* Acetaminophen (fever reduction, if needed)
* Thermometer (check at least twice a day, AM/PM) 
* Neti pot (was helpful to me with managing post nasal drip) 
* Hot steaming showers (loosens mucus)
* Lots of water + coconut water/pedialyte as needed for hydration

## Tips<a name="tips"></a>

* Stay home and isolate as best as possible! If you aren't sure if you have it, assume you may be infected and are highly contagious.
* Keep a daily symptoms and medications log. All interactions with a doctor will likely be over telephone, and this will help you be able to more clearly communicate with them as well as have a sense of timeline. I have shared mine below.
* If you have post nasal drip, do whatever it takes to keep it from getting to your chest where it could develop into pneumonia. Dry cough will likely be unproductive; clear throat and spit if you have to. Mucinex, hot tea with honey, steamy showers, humidifier, and lots of hydration are all things to help keep mucus loose.
* Get what medicines (and food) you need together at home, if possible: I was told that despite having difficulty breathing, unless I was choking or having trouble standing or finishing sentences, or unless I developed a high grade fever, I was considered mild and told not to come in.
* Things will likely be up and down. You might feel well one hour and then feel bad the next. Rest plenty and monitor yourself carefully. If you feel you are in danger, call a healthcare professional.
* Do daily light yoga and breathing exercises, so long as you are able to. This will help you monitor your breathing while developing your breathing capacity. I didn't have the presence of mind to write this while most sick, but I was doing these every day as much as possible while sick and I am certain it helped. These Qigong exercises have been really helpful:
